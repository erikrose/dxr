    Filter classes, which roughly correspond to the items in the Filters
    dropdown menu, tell DXR how to query the data stored in elasticsearch by
    :meth:`~dxr.plugins.FileToIndex.needles` and
    :meth:`~dxr.plugins.FileToIndex.needles_by_line`. An instance is created
    for each query term whose :attr:`name` matches and persists through the
    querying and highlighting phases.

    This is an optional base class that saves code on many filters. It also
    serves to document the filter API.

    :ivar name: The string prefix used in a query term to activate this
        filter. For example, if this were "path", this filter would be
        activated for the query term "path:foo". Multiple filters can be
        registered against a single name; they are ORed together. For example,
        it is good practice for a language plugin to query against a language
        specific needle (like "js-function") but register against the more
        generic "function" here. (This allows us to do language-specific
        queries.)
    :ivar domain: Either LINE or FILE. LINE means this filter returns results
        that point to specific lines of files; FILE means they point to files
        as a whole. Default: LINE.
    :ivar description: A description of this filter for the Filters menu:
        unicode or Markup (in case you want to wrap examples in ``<code>``
        tags). Of filters having the same name, the description of the first
        one encountered will be used. An empty description will hide a filter
        from the menu. This should probably be used only internally, by the
