"""Continuous deployment script for DXR

Glossary
========

build directory - A folder containing these folders...

    dxr - A checkout of the DXR source code
    target - A symlink to the instance to serve
    virtualenv - A virtualenv with DXR and its dependencies installed

    Builds are named after an excerpt of their git hashes and are symlinked
    into the deployment directory.

deployment directory - The folder containing these folders...

    builds - A folder of builds, including the current production and staging
        ones
    dxr-prod - A symlink to the current production build
    dxr-staging - A symlink to the current staging build
    instances - A folder of DXR instances organized according to format version

# When we need to make this work across multiple nodes:
# I really have no reason to use Commander over Fabric: I don't need Chief, and
# nearly all the features and conveniences Commander had over Fabric have been
# since implemented in Fabric. Fabric has more features and more support and
# was released more recently. OTOH, Fabric's argument conventions are crazy.
